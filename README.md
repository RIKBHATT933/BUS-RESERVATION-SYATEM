Hence the resevation system for the Bus reservation has been designed to remove all the deficiency from which the present system is suffering and to ensure.
PROBLEM DEFINITION:-
This system is based on a concept to reserve bus tickets. From this system, the user can view bus list, book tickets, cancel bookings and check bus status board. While booking tickets, the user has to enter bus number then the system displays total bus seat numbers with passengers name and the user has to enter the number of tickets, seat number, and name of the person. Here, cancel booking also features refunding. Login system is also available in this system to make it more secure. There’s no chance of data misuse or loss & it’s not time-consuming. The whole project is developed in ‘C’ Programming language, different variables and strings have been used for the development of this project. It’s easy to operate and understand by users.
